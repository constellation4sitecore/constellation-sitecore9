	<summary>Sitecore Helix-style library that adds author-controlled Http Redirect capabilities.</summary>
	<description>
Requires Sitecore 9.1
Requires .NET 4.7.1

Constellation is a collection of utilities for .NET CMS implementers.

The Feature.Redirects namespace contains two discrete functional components:

Page Redirects: Items that are meant to be interspersed with Page type Items in the content tree so that dynamically generated navigation
will list these Items as if they were part of that tree branch, although the actual target is elsewhere, or an entirely different site altogether.

Marketing Redirects: Items that represent "short, catchy" URLs that then redirect deeper into the site. Also a way to teach search engines
about URLs that have been permanently relocated. Marketing Redirects are managed through a discrete "application" in the Sitecore desktop.
Exporting and importing redirect lists is supported. All redirects are tested for validity before they are allowed to be imported.

The porting and development of this library has been kindly supported by Verndale (verndale.com)
