				If you're having issues where Sitecore fails to start, ensure that this processor is installed DEAD LAST in the

				that modify the initialize pipeline, like UCommerce or Glass.

			defaultProcessorType: Must descend from the default value - Constellation.Foundation.PackageVerification.PackageProcessor, Constellation.Foundation.PackageVerification
			defaultInstallMode="Merge" mergeMode="Clear"
			defaultMergeMode: [Append|Clear|Merge] default: Clear
			
			
			package nodes: 
					name: Just to make them easy to spot. Should be unique. Also allows you to sc:patch them!
					packageFileName: the name of the .zip file. IMPORTANT: should already exist in data-folder/packages.
					installMode: [Merge|Overwrite|SideBySide|Skip] if not supplied, default is used.
					mergeMode: [Append|Clear|Merge] if not supplied, default is used.
					processorOverrideType: If you don't want to use the default processor.
					
					Artifacts: Items that will exist if the package referenced was previously installed. Should be something a user wouldn't modify.
					You can supply more than one if you have to check multiple databases or disparate parts of the content tree.
					Please note that the fewer artifacts you have to verify the better for performance reasons.
					
					id: the ID of the Item that should exist
					database: the database where the Item lives, typically master or core.
