			<site name="website">

			<!--  USE SERVER-SIDE REDIRECT FOR REQUEST ERRORS
			
			Overwrite the default value (false) because the Redirect Manager needs to use Server.Transfer instead of Response.Redirect 
			to redirect request to service pages when an error occurs (item not found, access denied etc).
			This will allow the Redirect Manager to set an appropriate response code.
